# Testing bot

This is a testing bot that will listen to Discord messages. When active, it will start posting each and every message to Twitter (including attachments).



## To-do:
  * Error handling - when attachments fail to upload, if bot fails, etc.
  * Customization - listen for usernames, post to specific user, listen for reactions, etc.
  * Refactor / cleanup
  * Translate to Python (for r/TropicalWeather purposes)
  * Testing
  * Deployment
